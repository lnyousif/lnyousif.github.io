# About Laith Yousif

Laith Yousif was born and raised in Baghdad. After completing his Master's degree in Communication Engineering, he decided to leave Iraq, with no clear plan, in search of new opportunities and hope. In 2001, he arrived in the United States and began working at the World Trade Center. Following the tragic events of 9/11, Laith faced a challenging political climate that restricted his ability to return home and see his family. In 2003, he sought asylum in the U.S., and over the years, he continued to advocate for Iraqi refugees, representing their plight to the UNHCR in 2006 and 2007. After years of separation, his family joined him safely in 2010.

Now a U.S. citizen, Laith works in technology and lives in Brooklyn with his wife, son, and daughter.

## Blogging Journey: From Baghdad to New York

In 2002, Laith launched a blog called *From Baghdad to New York*, where he shared articles and perspectives on the needs of everyday Iraqis. This blog was later renamed *Better Iraq* and continues to serve as a platform for his reflections and advocacy.

## Media Features and Advocacy

Laith's story has been featured in numerous publications and media outlets:

- **Time Magazine** (2008) — *Laith Yousif: Iraqi 9/11 Survivor*
- **Dissent Magazine** — *No Refuge Here: Iraqis Flee*
- **ABC News** — Interview on the eve of Saddam Hussein’s execution
- **The Wind of Amal** (2012) — A documentary following the lives of three Iraqi refugees in the U.S., including Laith.

## New Ventures: Stand-Up Comedy

Recently, Laith ventured into stand-up comedy. You can find a link to one of his routines [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dggo_fIWfAc).
