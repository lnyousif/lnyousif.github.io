A blog I started in 2002 as the drums of war against Iraq began to beat. The news portrayed Iraq as a backward country with no civilized people, selling the war as an easy choice to get rid of a terrible dictator (which he was) and save the Iraqi people who were supposedly hopeless (which was neither the goal nor meant to help them).

I insisted on picking stories that resonated with how Iraqis felt at that time. Over the years, I kept adding more information. Even after shutting down my old domain name, FromBaghdadToNewYork.com, I kept the content to preserve the work I had done.
