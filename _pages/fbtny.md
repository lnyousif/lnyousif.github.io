A blog I started in 2002 as the drums of the war against Iraq started. The news portated Iraq as this backward country that have no civilised people and sold the war as an easy choice to get rid of a terrible dictator (Which he was was) and save the Iraqi peopler who are hopeless (Which was not the goal nor it meant to hekp them).

I insisted on picking the story that resonate with how Iraqi felt at that time, and ovr the years I kept adding more info , even after shutting down my old domain name FromBaghdadToNewYork.com I kept the content for my own interest in preserving the work I have done.
