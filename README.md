# Welcome to My Personal Website

Here, you'll find a collection of my past projects and writings, including:

- **Blabby Me** — my original blog.
- **From Baghdad to New York** — posts from my Iraq-focused blog.
- **Humor Writing** — pieces from a separate site where I shared my humorous writing.
- **Class Reflections** — thoughts and insights from various classes I've taken.
- **Arabic Poetry** — poems written during a period when I was inspired to create in Arabic.

This site is a blend of these experiences—and more. Enjoy exploring!
