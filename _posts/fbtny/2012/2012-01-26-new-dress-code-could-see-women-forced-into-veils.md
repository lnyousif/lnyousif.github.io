in an Arabic Interview with her she said that she get her Husband approval for everything becauseshe beleive she is less than him. Added to that she said that she visited some christian neighborhood  because she heard that the suicide rate in that area was high as if Muslim women in Iraq are living in luxury. I wonder what she was smoking during that interview,  maybe what her husband was smoking since have been doing all the thinking for her.

New guidelines on how the Iraqi government’s female employees should dress have caused a furore. The conservative Ministry of Women’s affairs says it is protecting female dignity while women’s rights advocates say it’s an attack on personal freedoms.

The guidelines had already been decided on late last year but when a local newspaper published details of exactly how the Iraqi government’s female employees should be dressing, controversy was bound to ensue.

The recommendations made by the Higher National Committee for the Advancement of Iraqi Women\*, which is chaired by the federal Minister for Women’s Affairs, Ibtihal al-Zaidi, had been decided upon in September 2011. However details were only revealed by the Baghdad daily, Al Mada, a few days ago.
