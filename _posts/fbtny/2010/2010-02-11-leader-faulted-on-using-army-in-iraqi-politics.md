Its obvious that someone is enjoying the last days of the power and authority as its obvious for them they won’t have a chance in our new elections or at least this what people should vote for “ A CHANGE” …. OK you came you worked a lot for Iraq and contributed a little at least by results on the ground… OK you can leave now and let someone else try and see what they can do and implement their ideas, theories and experience if any ….!!! we accepted the idea of 2003 war only because we wanted a change.. arresting people on political disagreements and conflicts is just sending flashbacks from pre-2003 era.
