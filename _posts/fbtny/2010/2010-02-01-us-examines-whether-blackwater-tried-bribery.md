WASHINGTON — The Justice Department is investigating whether officials of [Blackwater Worldwide](https://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/blackwater_usa/index.html?inline=nyt-org "More articles about Blackwater USA.") tried to bribe Iraqi government officials in hopes of retaining the firm’s security work in Iraq after a deadly shooting episode in 2007, according to current and former government officials.

The lawyer Jaafar al-Mousawi said he worked with Blackwater to compensate Iraqis.

The officials said that the Justice Department’s fraud section opened the inquiry late last year to determine whether Blackwater employees violated a federal law banning American corporations from paying bribes to foreign officials.

The inquiry is the latest fallout from the shooting in Nisour Square in Baghdad, which left 17 Iraqis dead and stoked bitter resentment against the United States.
