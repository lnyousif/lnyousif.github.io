Operations to be measured by results and achievements on the ground…. The case in our country is that nobody out there is sincere, worried nor cautious… No the name does not matter whether It was Iraq’s freedom, liberation or Iraqi Democracy !!! what really matters is the new intentions with that name and whats behind the horizon!? what plans been made, what acts need to be done to reach the goals that pour to the interest of the people and their country..!! Americans voted for President Obama only because they wanted the CHANGE and they made it. Thats the type of change we should look for … Hopefully, one day all of us will do the same to accomplish and fulfill the idea of a better Iraq.
