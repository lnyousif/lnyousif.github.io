am posting this link with a lot of pain and agony. Our country shed a lot of blood, sacrificed a lot of souls. When you surf the internet you expect to find all type of websites( blogs, news..etc). Who will think that there is a website for counting Iraqi bodies..!? I personally felt so sorry for the catastrophic numbers my eyes came across. Its been a tragedy of what happened to our country. The question is “ Is there an end?” and if so “ When ?”.Hopefully,  Very soon.
