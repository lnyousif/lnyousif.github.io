I am reading a book called “Imperial life in the emerald city”<div>and this part made laugh and cry at the same time _Barbra Bodien_ is a veteran diplomat who speaks Arabic, got a word from an Iraqi contact (usually because the state department looked into good contact with locals, compared to others with know it all mentality) that looters are close to breaking into the Assyrian Vault under the Central Bank in Baghdad. so she notify CENTCOM and had something like this  exchange 

**BODINE**: The Assyrian vault under the central Bank is in immediate danger of being looted, we need to get on this.  
**CENTCOM**: whats in the Assyrian vault?  
**BODINE:** Assyrian Treasure.  
**CENTCOM**: Whats an Assyrian Treasure?  
**BODINE**: Go read the early chapters of your bible, its old stuff, its relay relay valuable , we need to save it.  
**CENTCOM**: OKay, we’ll see what we can do.
