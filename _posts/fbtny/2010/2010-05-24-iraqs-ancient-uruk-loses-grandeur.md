Iraq’s largest archaeological site is in danger and may be lost forever, an Iraqi scientist says.

Hadiya Jwan al-Khalidi, head of Muthana University’s History Department, urged the authorities to move quickly to save Uruk before it was too late.

She said Uruk was not “an ordinary archaeological site. I am really sad to see what has become of this treasure.”

Situated east of the present course of the Euphrates, the site was known to the Sumerians as Unu. The Akkadians called it Uruk.
