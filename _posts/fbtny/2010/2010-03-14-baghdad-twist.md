I wish I can change the date under this short movie and write Baghdad 2010 and the images sent from our beloved country now to be re-titled Baghdad in 50s…. which one more civilized? where you felt more culture and knowledge? in this shots from 50s and 60s OR the images been broadcasted everyday…! OR in  now with all uneducated people: victims of one of the worst dictatorships in the history of the palnet, a whole complete generation of indoctrination and mal-treatment….Please enjoy the watch. and yes we were merged with all types of people and endured our diversities so beautifully and all were proud of it
