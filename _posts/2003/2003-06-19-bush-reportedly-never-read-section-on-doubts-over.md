WASHINGTON, July 19 — Responding to allegations that it falsified some of its case for war with Iraq, the Bush administration on Friday released parts of an intelligence assessment from October that cited “compelling evidence” that Iraq was trying to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program. The document included a notation from the State Department calling an assertion at the center of the controversy “highly dubious,” but a White House official said Bush never read that section of the report, according to the Washington Post.
