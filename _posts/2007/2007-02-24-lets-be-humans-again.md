Yes this what we have at this point, a culture that is so filthy that i feel disgusted writing this article about how we treat human being inside our society, in fact we do not treat anyone the way they deserve, we do treat them based on filthy centuries old of empty slogans and empty minds.  

I read few articles about what is happening to Iraq right now and the news Sabreen Al-Janaby, a girl who accused the Iraqi police of rapping her, and all the following response to that, and i was desperately looking for one decent voice that give this story in reasonable way and not through sectarian divide, but no all arguing against her or for her, no one asked the question, even if she is not truthful, why not we give her the chance of proving her case, she is human being, and she deserve the right of any other human. As much as I disagree with using TV channels to expose the story, but put yourself in her shoes , she have no one listening to her and she had to do something with a practice that need to be changed inside our daily lives. If I was in her shoes even though no one can claim they know the pain that others go through, i will make as much noise, and i will not care about all those hypocritical voices who treat women as if they are half human, if she is touched then she is not good anymore, if she got attacked its more appropriate for her to shut up because if she did something about it she will look like a reckless girl, what a filthy culture, what a pathetic stage we reached with all this backward mentality.

When we gonna grow out of this and teach the next generation how we can respect humans, one prominent blogger who i agree with her in most of the occasions took the story into a level that forced me to finish the article to just see what she is aiming at, at the end it was a barrage of slogans that have no meaning at all. another article question the girl credibility just because she used graphic details. what the heck is our problem, I think we are so sick in many ways. especially when it comes to how we treat humans.

I was hopping that some voices will be more toward how the girl should be treated, even if she is supporting insurgent, even if she was used by insurgent. that do not give anyone to abuse her, this is a matter that is very important and personal to her and only her. and those who involve family inside it are just bunch of hypocrites. our family structure is exactly like our dictatorship leadership in our lands, they want to have the last say without questioning. and here we are against judging the human value of this person by her cry for justice (even if she is making it up, we all know that this issue is covered inside our god fearing hypocrisy culture), we need a change in this attitude, we badly need a change, we need to stop covering up our faces into whats happening in our culture, why girls have to have no emotions till whenever their family and and the society approve.

I am not calling for equality, because taking right and giving them are different sides of the same coin, but we have to be human and respect each other and appreciate each other and run away from the culture of prejudice and inhuman behaviour.

I wish that one day i can see more open society, and get away from the filthy and stupid mentality that we are living in. We came from the cradle of civilization, I am sure we can be humans again.
