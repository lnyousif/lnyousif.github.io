I have very strong discussions about Hijab, and because I strongly believe in “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it” (Evelyn Beatrice Hall not Voltaire) . To me Hijab is a personal choice and I always thought of it that way, But one long debate with a very smart friend made me find the sharp line that can identify people who use that freedom to cover up their racism or their close minded view about women rights.  
If you think about it Hijab and Prostitution is the same subject from the prospect of allowing freedoms to flourish. It’s the same concept of allowing women their rights. It’s her right to wear Hijab, also it’s her right to work in prostitution.  
Also in both cases men use women for their own interest, Hijab is a symbol of men trying to manipulate women, prostitution is also mostly forced on women by men for economical reasons, Not all cases in both , Some have religious belief in Hijab and that is their right, and others want to work in prostitution as their choice, Those we should never judge.  
Also, keep in mind that most girls are forced into Hijab before the age of adulthood or consent, So does most of the prostitutes. Also in both cases it’s very difficult to decipher when the brainwashing end and the actual choice begins.  
So if your view is agreeing with one and hating the other, You are a bigger problem than you ever thought.
