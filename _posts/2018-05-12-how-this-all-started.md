Mattel Aquarius:

This is the first computer I ever had, my father bought it to me on 1986, I started using it as a game console and my cousin Raid taught me how to write some programs so I wrote my first program for tracking the world soccer Cup in Mexico 1986. I did not have a recording media , so each time I use the machine I was rewriting the program, which I have wrote on paper and each time I improve it a little. I wrote many software on this machine, one was to give what was the day of the week for any date (Which was a big deal at this machine). and many other small software. The specification of the device are laughable when it is compared to these days machines

NEC PC 6001 Computer.

This is the computer that I can say I learned professional programming with. I Developed the Burger Time game for this machine after I enjoyed playing the game at Aquarius machine before and also developed the soccer games prediction software.
