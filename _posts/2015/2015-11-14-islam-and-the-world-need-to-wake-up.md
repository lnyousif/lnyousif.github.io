The world need to wake up and fix itself, Islam need to wake up and fix itself. The refugees are the victims, Paris is a victim , people who want to live happily are the victims. Let’s not mix things in a very close minded way. Islam need to isolate those mental cases hijacking it. Its not about silent majority, it’s about acknowledging the shit show happening in your name. Stop blaming everyone else on the problems. try to address that issue from within. and The west have to acknowledge that their shitty intervernest stupidity is also to blame. own it and start helping powers that will eliminate religious powers . instead of just supporting more idiotic groups than the ones you are fighting.
