Have a look at this beautiful Sumerian piece of art depicting the three different social classes that were recognised in the community at that timeâ€¦The Layer at the top of the Pyramid or the (Upper Class) represents the nobles, priests, government officials and warriorsâ€¦The (Middle Class), or the layer in the middle represents the merchants, traders and artisansâ€¦The (Lower Class) constituted the majority of population, containing serfs and slaves that were responsible for all manual labor. Please check out this siteâ€¦. you will find an interactive depiction of this sculpture (The Peace Side), so you can click on the different parts of the drawings to see a bigger (magnificated) portion of the sculptureâ€¦.Furthermore, you will see an arrow at the bottom right corner of the sculpture, you can click on that to see the back of it (The War Side)â€¦ you can also see different magnificated portions of that side as wellâ€¦The Peace Side represents the Sumerian Society and its three divisions of social classes (Upper, Middle, Lower)â€¦.The War Side represents the different classes of the Sumerian Army (Chariots, Soldiers, Warriors)â€¦.Here are pictures of the two sidesâ€¦
