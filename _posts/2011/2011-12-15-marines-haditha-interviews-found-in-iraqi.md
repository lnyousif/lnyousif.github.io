I dont even know what to say, but it seems to me that most solders are kids who assume war is more like a video game, they would shoot and then keep asking why those people are shooting at us. on the other hands Iraqis seems to expect American solders to fix everything for them. At the end of the day, many live lost for a decision made by 2 so called leaders who did not really respect these lives.

The Irony is that many of these stories are lost in a junkyard.
