I dont think I need to add a lot more text than the poinnts mentioned in this article on the their website, even though the article is about the New UNICEF Iraq Ambassador Kadhum Al-Sahir, but the value is really inside the post.

Source UNICEF:

In the 1970s, Iraq was one of the best countries in the Middle East and North Africa to be a child, but due to decades of war and neglect, it has become one of the worst. Some of the issues facing Iraqâ€™s 15 million children now include the following:

- Each year, around 35,000 infants die before reaching their first birthday
- Over 1.5 million children under the age of five are undernourished
- Around 700,000 children are not enrolled in primary school, while hundreds of thousands more drop out before graduating
- 2.5 million children do not have access to safe water, and 3.5 million lack adequate sanitation facilities
- Around 800,000 children between the ages of 5 and 14 are working.
