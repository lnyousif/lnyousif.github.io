I am trying to translate things quickly but wanted to let people see whats happening in Iraq, and do not forget how Iraqis are treated under this government, This government called this rescue operation a success (yes believe it or not they did call it a successful operation).

Please share and let people see whats really happening for the innocent people in Iraq, nd try to watch the video , even if you dont understand the language you can see the pain and suffering of those people

the guy is talking about the attack on Sayedat Al-Najat church in Baghdad on October 31, 2010 through  an interview with a Christian channel NourSat in the middle east

his son got killed in that attack, he is explaining what he saw during the time he spent outside waiting for his family to get rescued, the 2 girls around him are his daughters who both were next to their brother (the guys son, and his young child) (who both got killed).

his son called him at 5:15PM when the attackers went into the church so he told his son to hide, At 5:30 he called his son again and the son said that the attackers are shooting randomly and killing people, and the father heard the shooting as a background noise during the phone call, this was the last time he was able to speak to his son.

He made it to the church at 6: an Iraqi officer helped him get close to the church, he is explaining that the smoke was going out of the church and the police and the army was around there by the hundreds but they were just sitting and doing nothing, in fact he was saying that it looked like they were chitchating as if nothing happened.

He is saying that from 6:00PM till 8:30 there were killing inside the church while the army and police outside doing Nothing, they were just standing there, every 15 minutes there would be shooting and then quite.

He said I told the officers that I know the back stairs of the church and can help you and get you in but no one listened , He said till the terrorist finished all their ammunition , nothing was done, the officers were sitting as if they cared less,

He said if the Minister of defense or the Minster of interior family were Christians would of they waited that long, He said most of the top ranking officers were doing nothing , just sitting around and chit chatting, and they even told him to not  get aggravated (its only 20 people in the church), he got furious as he have (8 of his family members inside)  and told them “In the western world they negotiate and try to save one person life and you tell me to be quite for only 20 people” , he mentioned that there were hundreds inside the church (the estimated number was 120 ).

Till the SWAT team arrived at 9:00 PM nothing was done by either the police nor the army, while the terrorist were kept killing people, he said even when the SWAT came and went into the church the terrorist did not have any ammunition anymore and even when they went in, it was a mess and they may have killed even more innocent people.

And above all that they said that after the SWAT finished they just left and also the army and the police, they did not even help in clearing the church from the bodies, the only help came from the ministry of health as the ambulances were taking people to the hospitals, otherwise till 1:00 AM there were no one helping to move the bodies.

He is saying also that there is even probability that some terrorist made it out with the people.

He says the we are the Christian in Iraq is second class citizen, thats why they did not care, He was getting very angry at the government and how some people look at Iraqi Christians as a tool for the American in Iraq, and he said that him and his grandparents and his great great great grandparents are from Iraq “the American did not bring us here, this land is our land as much as its for any other Iraqi.”
