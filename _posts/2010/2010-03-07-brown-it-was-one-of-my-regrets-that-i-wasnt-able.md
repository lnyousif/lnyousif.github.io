Regrets..! Is that it.? total lack of planning for post war period costs the lives of hundereds of thousands. I fell anxious to attaian that whoever in charge now did not learn the lesson….Iraqis are really unfortunate and obviously no body on this planet cares or bothers about them being killed, slaughtered and diplaced forcefully. Pre-war era: they were sent to dungeons, tortured and mal treated in every single aspect then when they agreed the war as a price to get rid of one of the darkest ages in Baghdads history, they ended with more killing and losses… ! Now all they can get is REGRETS?!!!
