I am trying to translate things quickly but wanted to let people see whats happening in Iraq, and do not forget how Iraqis are treated under this government, This government called this rescue operation a success (yes believe it or not they did call it a successful operation).

this video of a girl who had a brother and sister and a young child (nephew) that got killed during the attack, she was one of the hostages,

She is very emotional as you can see in the video,  she is describing the attacker and what they did. this is how she explain it

The attackers went into the church by having couple of explosions and the smoke start to enter the church, when the priest went out to tell them to cool down they right away shot him, her and her sister and Auday (her brother and his son (Adam)), there was few young men they attackers were telling each other to kill all of them.

His young child named Adam (was crying and attached to his dad), the kid was scared, his dad is trying to calm him down, the girls (2 sisters) were very close to their brother and his son, all scared and shaking, the only one who was trying to calm them is the brother. he was telling  his sisters that these people will take money and leave, so just keep quite.

but the attackers went and shot the  brother on the shoulder, his child started crying, and one of the girls got shot in the leg and fell over the brother and the child,

this girl was explaining how she moved that girl from above her nephew because so that the kid can  breath.

She is explaining: The terrorist kept throwing grande toward us, and he was telling us that you all infernal gonna go to hell even when you live you are in hell, while no matter what we do, we are going to heaven,

she was explaining how cold blooded those terrorist are, while all the carnage around them the discussion between them was like this

Terroist 1: Is everything good with you,

Terroist 2: : am good, dont worry about me

Terroist 1: did you pray

Terroist 2: ya I did

all this while they are shooting innocent people ,

Adam (the young child) voice went down and I did not know what happen to him and could not do anything , she was scared when her phone went on and started vibrating and one of the terrorist was looking for the cause of the noise, she hid the phone quickly into her purse and laid over the purse so that they wont find her and her sister.

One of The terrorist started praying then blow himself up, she was trying to check if her sister was alive,

then the Army went in, but we did not know them and we though they were terrorist too (I think they were playing dead), so the army identified themselves as army and start asking people to leave if they are alive, she moved and searched for her brother son , using her cell phone light , she saw the child fully burned .

they left and church and it was a total mess the girl was crying and all what the army were doing is shouting at them to calm down , she shut them up. she was asking loudly whith all those army outside how come you keep us inside for so long (they were under siege for about 4 hours)

she said while leaving we were walking over flesh of people scattered around the church.
