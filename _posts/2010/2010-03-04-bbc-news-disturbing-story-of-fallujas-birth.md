This story is a repetition of what happened in Basrah in 1991 after the gulf war, both times it was totally ignored because lives of poor people are not important to news organization and also because of the access to highly influential officials who may deny the news agencies the access to them if they did so.I wonder how can such issues be ignored when all the victims are kids who their only problem is that they were born in the wrong place at the wrong time
