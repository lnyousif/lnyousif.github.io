Its very interesting that after nearly seven years and hundreds of thousands of casualties, there is still argument over whether it was legal or not (although it turned out there were no WMDs and security council disapproved) and whether it was a good thing or not…how much is the value or one human life, and whats the price tag of “democracy” in order to do the calculation and figure it all out?

  
\* Senior lawyers advised no basis in law for war  
\* Second U.N. resolution was required, lawyers say  
\* Issue could embarrass both Blair and BrownLONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - One of Britain’s top legal advisers during the run up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq said on Tuesday he believed the military action was illegal. Michael Wood, the most senior legal adviser at Britain’s Foreign Office until 2006, told an inquiry examining Britain’s role in the war a United Nations resolution authorising the use of force had been required to make the military action lawful.
