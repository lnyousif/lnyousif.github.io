Another disturbing news from Iraq and a disturbing way to report it to,   

below Quote from “Jerusalem Post”

“For centuries Jews, Christians and Muslims came to Al-Kifl, a small  
town south of Baghdad, to visit the tomb of the Prophet Ezekiel and  
pray.  
The distinctive Jewish character of the Al-Kifl shrine, namely the  
Hebrew inscriptions and the Torah Ark, never bothered the gentile  
worshipers. In the 14th century a minaret was built next to the  
shrine, but the interior design remained Jewish. The vast majority of  
Iraq’s Jewish community left some 60 years ago, but Shi'ites took good  
care of the holy site.Until now. Recently "Ur,” a local Iraqi news  
agency, reported that a huge mosque will be built on top of the grave  
by Iraq’s Antiquities and Heritage Authority, while Hebrew  
inscriptions and ornaments are being removed from the site, all as  
part of renovations.“

whats disturbing about the act is the total disregard to all the  
history and value that these places mean, Not only from religious  
prospective.

but again to sell more copies the Post could not resist just report  
the ill act of those responsible about such an act and made the title  
generalize against Iraqi people instead of pointing out that the board  
of antiques is pretty much swayed by those who have a narrow minded  
approach, the article title unfairly says "Iraq erases Jewish identity  
of Prophet Ezekiel from tomb”
