I think its good news and bad news at the same time, Less diversity is bad in election, but at the same time less religious-political mix is welcomed, Its not about Sunni or Shia but any party that identify itself with one group or another is a bad  choice, I hope the Other religious parties will follow suit (which will not happen) and we turn into decent choices between ideas not religious beleives.Source: Washington PostBAGHDAD – Iraqs main Sunni party said Saturday it is dropping out of next month’s national elections, seizing on U.S. concerns about Iran influence in the political process as proof that the vote will not be legitimate.
