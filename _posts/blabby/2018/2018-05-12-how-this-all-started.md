Mattel Aquarius:

This is the first computer I ever had. My father bought it for me in 1986. I started using it as a game console, but my cousin Raid taught me how to write some programs. I wrote my first program for tracking the World Cup in Mexico in 1986. I did not have any recording media, so each time I used the machine, I had to rewrite the program from paper, improving it a little each time. I wrote many programs on this machine; one calculated the day of the week for any given date (which was a big deal for this machine), along with many other small programs. The specifications of the device are laughable when compared to today's machines.

NEC PC 6001 Computer.

This is the computer on which I truly learned professional programming. I developed a version of the game *Burger Time* for this machine after enjoying it on the Aquarius. I also developed soccer game prediction software.
