**FADE IN**

**INT. HOUSE KITCHEN – MORNING**  

*(Alan, looking visibly tired, sits at the kitchen table. Berta is bustling around as Charlie walks in, cheerful and smug.)*  

**Alan** *(half asleep)*: What's wrong with you, man? I haven't slept well for two weeks.  

**Charlie** *(grinning)*: Ditto.  

**Alan**: I don't know if I should feel bad for your girlfriend or send a hate letter to Pfizer.  

**Charlie**: Try both.  

**Alan**: You appreciate the blue pill that much?  

**Charlie**: No, you schmuck. Two girls.  

**Alan** *(shocked)*: You've been in a threesome for two weeks? God, God, God—you really do exist.  

*(Berta stops, listening with newfound interest as she exits the kitchen.)*  

**Berta**: That's going straight into my memoir.  

**Charlie**: No, you half-functional excuse for a man—I’m *dating* two girls.  

**Alan**: What’s new with that?  

**Charlie**: Well, these two happen to be friends.  

**Alan**: Seriously? Aren’t there enough women out there who just fall at your feet? Why friends?  

**Charlie**: Hey, I asked myself the same thing.  

**Alan** *(slyly)*: Wow, getting thoughtful, are we? *(muttering)* About time.  

**Charlie**: Not really—they just complement each other.  

**Alan**: You mean their personalities?  

**Charlie**: Nope. One’s… enthusiastic in bed, and the other’s more… giving, if you know what I mean.  

**Berta**: Giving? I used to be like that... until Michael Douglas broke my heart.  

*(Alan and Charlie look at her, shocked.)*  

**Alan**: *Michael Douglas?!*  

**Berta**: What, you think I can’t score Douglas?  

**Alan**: No, no, of course you can, but...  

**Berta**: Well, technically, it wasn’t him. But my landlord looked *exactly* like him. At least I got away without paying the rent.  

**Charlie**: Alan, there’s an idea for when you move out.  

**Alan**: *“When”*? Really? You still have hope?  

**Berta**: So, Charlie, you’re tending two gardens?  

**Alan**: Buttering two muffins?  

**Berta**: Cleaning two carpets?  

*(Jake enters, oblivious but joining in with enthusiasm.)*  

**Jake**: Feeding two kittens?  

**Alan** *(angry)*: Jake, how long have you been here?  

**Jake**: Since you “tended” to Mom.  

**Charlie** *(laughing)*: Attaboy!  

**Alan**: Watch your mouth, Jake!  

**Berta**: Zippy, you should be proud he’s not like you.  

**Alan** *(annoyed, changing the subject)*: So, Charlie, how come neither of these girls knows about the other?  

**Berta**: They’re mute, aren’t they? *(walks to the door as the bell rings)*  

**Charlie**: The magic of “let’s keep this quiet so we can build something without interference.”  

**Alan**: You’re a real jerk, you know that? What are you gonna do when they find out?  

*(Evelyn walks in, ignoring the situation entirely.)*  

**Evelyn**: Alan, I need your help.  

**Alan**: Love you too, Mom.  

**Evelyn**: I need you to go pick up my stuff from the man I was seeing.  

**Alan**: Why don’t you get it yourself?  

**Evelyn**: Probably because he saw me topless in another man’s car.  

**Alan**: Mom, we *do not* need to know that.  

**Berta**: Like mother, like son.  

**Jake**: Dad, you still expect me to be normal?  

**Charlie**: Thanks, Mom. That image will haunt me forever.  

**Evelyn**: Oh, Charlie, just attach it to *36D*.  

**Charlie** *(loudly)*: *Mom!*  

*(Jake hurries out, horrified. Berta mutters to herself.)*  

**Berta**: Memoir, memoir, memoir...

**FADE OUT**

**INT. BAR – NIGHT**  

*(Charlie is at the bar, chatting with Brooke, one of the girls he's dating. He looks tired but tries to play it off.)*  

**Brooke**: Charlie, you look exhausted. I thought a day off was good for you?  

**Charlie**: I was up all night... thinking about you, babe.  

**Brooke**: So sweet! You make me feel... giving.  

**Charlie**: I don’t know if that’s possible, but I’ll take it.  

*(Alan walks in, surprised to see Charlie with Brooke.)*  

**Alan** *(feigning surprise)*: Charlie! Didn’t expect to see you here.  

**Charlie**: Alan! What a… coincidence.  

**Alan**: And who’s this lovely lady?  

**Charlie**: Brooke, this is my *“insect”* brother, Alan.  

**Alan** *(sarcastically)*: *Lovely* to meet you, Brooke.  

*(Charlie spots Laura, his other girlfriend, entering the bar and panics internally.)*  

**Charlie** *(thinking to himself)*: No kissing. No kissing. Think, Charlie, think!  

**Laura** *(approaching)*: Hey, Charlie!  

*(Charlie sneezes dramatically into his hand and holds it out as a shield.)*  

**Charlie**: Hey, Laura! Uh, feeling a little… under the weather.  

**Laura**: You were fine earlier!  

**Charlie**: Yeah, I guess it hit me... food poisoning maybe?  

*(Brooke and Laura exchange glances, confused.)*  

**Laura**: So, Brooke, you come here often?  

**Brooke**: Sometimes. Charlie brought me here.  

*(Charlie sneezes again to disrupt the conversation.)*  

**Laura**: Funny, Alan said Charlie might be here.  

**Charlie** *(angrily muttering)*: *Thanks*, Alan.  

**Alan**: Oh, did I mention Laura drove me here? *(grins at Charlie)*  

**Charlie** *(desperate to change the subject)*: Alan, did you do that errand for Mom?  

**Alan**: Oh, our cheating mother?  

**Laura**: *Cheating* mother?  

*(Charlie looks increasingly uncomfortable.)*  

**Alan**: Yes, she’s sending me to pick up her stuff from some guy she cheated on.  

**Brooke**: That’s so sweet of you, Alan.  

**Charlie**: Alan, maybe it’s time you… go help Mom.  

**Alan** *(with a devilish grin)*: And miss this nice little gathering? Never.  

*(Laura and Brooke each place a hand on Charlie’s legs.)*  

**Charlie** *(panicking)*: So, Alan, why did both your wives leave you again?  

**Alan**: If I had a *decent handle*, maybe one would have stayed.  

**Laura**: Alan, you’re funny.  

**Brooke**: Unlike Charlie, who somehow manages to juggle two women...  

**Charlie** *(guilty)*: Actually… about that. Brooke, Laura… I have to confess.  

**Laura**: Go on, Charlie.  

**Brooke**: What is it?  

**Charlie**: I… I went out with both of you, not knowing who to choose. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone.  

**Laura** *(smiling)*: Oh, we knew the whole time.  

**Brooke**: We just wanted to see how long you’d keep it up.  

**Alan** *(flabbergasted)*: What?  

**Laura**: And hey, Brooke and I have had fun together too, so maybe we can try… all of us?  

**Alan** *(excited)*: Great idea!  

**Brooke**: Alan, don’t you have to get Mom’s stuff?  

**Charlie**: Yeah, Alan. Stay at Mom’s tonight… this could get interesting.  

*(Charlie, Brooke, and Laura exit together as Charlie gives Alan a smirk.)*  

**Charlie**: And grab the tab, would you?  

*(Alan stands there, stunned and exasperated.)*  

**Alan**: Un-freaking-believable.  

**FADE OUT**
