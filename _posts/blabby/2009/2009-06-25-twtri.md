# Twtri is the Grand Prize winner for Microsoft Azure NewCloudApp() ASP.NET Contest #


My http://Twtri.com  was announced as the Grand Prize winner for Microsoft Windows Azure NewCloudApp() ASP.NET Contest , I did put a lot of work on this app, as there was quite few difficulties and the info about the flight was sometimes very tricky.I am very excited about that win as it is a great feeling to see people appreciate your many hours of creating and fine tuning the app so it would work as simply and as useful for the users.

Finally thanks to Akeel Haider for the Logo design and his Photoshop skills :)
