Iraq elections and choices should not be analyzed by calling the public ignorant, to the contrary we should accept that even our secular behavior is very single minded and either force their views or call the rest stupid. Its an acceptance problem not a political problem. I think Iraq needs a well organized and respectful opposition and not a militia that disrespect the laws unless they get what they want. Also our liberals should gather together to fight corruption and sectarian appointment and make them very visible, I think this would be the first step toward better Iraq.
