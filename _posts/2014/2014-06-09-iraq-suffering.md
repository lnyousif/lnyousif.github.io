Iraq have been suffering tremendously year after year, the real problem is within the culture that Saddam created (this is not a single blame point). He destroyed the sense of “our country good” and turned into “Our religion good”, “our sect good” , “our Arab good”, “our Kurd good” , “our city good” or even worse “our tribe good” and now even our Iraqi cries for help only come out when one of these “ours” happen and never when all Iraq in need. The bloodshed will not end till all those “our” go away and only “our country” stays.
