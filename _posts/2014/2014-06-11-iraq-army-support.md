I dislike the Iraqi prime minister as much as any other person but this blame game does not take us anywhere, I donâ€™t want him to stay but the only way we can can get Iraq back on its feet is if we support the army against those religious militant. Its just a matter of stabilizing Iraq and then turning the tide around
