The Kurds have all the rights for getting their independence especially after they proved that they are the only part of Iraq that had healthy growth and almost zero violence because they did not fight internally and destroyed their land. That is said the borders may be way bigger issue than having their own country. It may sound appealing to have more land , but that could end up being worse with the instability of the country. The Kurds will win a lot but lose a lot too. Just look at the best example in the world now , the EU is uniting the differences not splitting them. I know Iraq is no Europe , but decisions need to be done with the long term in mind.
