Mesopotamian Mythology

This Article talks about the Mesopotamian Mythology: the different gods and goddesses, their relation to each other, and the specialty of each one. Since our civilization is the oldest one in the world, it always had a huge influence on other neighboring cultures, such as Persia, Phoenicia, and Greece… part of this influence was Mythology.The Greek Mythology (most famous in the world) greatly resembles ours in many different aspects, their philosophers have always founded their epics and stories on our Mesopotamian material, which is hundreds of years older… it was their source of inspiration.Below is a diagram, representing the (Family Tree) of the Mesopotamian deities. 1)

According to the Mesopotamian  
Mythology, at the very beginning there was only Abzu and Tiamat. Their union  
resulted in the creation of the universe, and the existence of all the other  
deities that followed. Both Abzu and Tiamat are considered supreme deities but  
yet, they have no temples at all.Abzu: The Sweet water Ocean God. The father of all the other gods and  
goddesses, and the creator of the universe. Husband of Tiamat, father of Anshar  
and Kishar.

(Abyss) comes from.Tiamat: The Salt water Ocean Goddess. The mother of all the other gods  
and goddesses, and the creator of the universe. Wife of Abzu, mother of Anshar  
and Kishar.

later killed by Marduk, who became the national god of Babylonians.Here, Tiamat is depicted as an innocent mermaid

According to our history, Tiamat felt jealous from the others deities, and  
decided to destroy the world. Nobody had enough courage to confront and  
challenge her except Marduk. A great battle marked the conflict between Marduk  
and Tiamat, the Good and the Evil. At the end, Marduk was victorious, he cut  
Tiamat in two halves, one half formed the Earth and the other half formed the  
Sky, and her two eyes created the two Rivers of Tigris and Euphrates. As a  
result, Marduk was considered a hero and became the National God of Babylonians.
